- 👋 Hi, I’m @miladingavric
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the world of technology and its impact on society, as well as photography, videography and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying software and information engineering at the TU Vienna and my focus is mostly on web app development. I'm also honing my photography skills and trying to improve them in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting tech projects, open-source contributions, or any creative ventures that align with my interests. If you have a project in mind or just want to chat about tech and creativity, feel free to reach out!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me a direct message here on social media, or you can email me at miladin_gavric@outlook.com. I'm also active on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/miladin-gavric-8a2014135) if you prefer to connect there. Let's start a conversation and see where our interests overlap!
